# TheSpice
A proof of concept Rust Operating System. Depending on the success, will move towards a WASM based OS.


## Phase 01
Implement a simple, Lisp-like language 

## Phase 02
Transpiles to JS and Rust

## Phase 03
Reactive/observable types?

## Key Features
Design goals:
* Statically typed
* Macro enabled
* Functionally reactive?
* Pure functions
* Massively parallelized
* Rust + JS compiling
* Utilizes a 'virtual DOM'-type thingy with an OPEN GL context?
* Maybe uses a 'actor' pattern, similiar to erlang?
